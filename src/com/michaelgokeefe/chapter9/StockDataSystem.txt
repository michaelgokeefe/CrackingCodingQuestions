ch. 9.1 Stock Data

Scope:

1000 client apps
Front-end service
Send EOD stock info
Data stored in any format

Assumptions:

Clients must request data
Server will send most recent EOD info
Stores EOD info for millions of companies

Important:

Client ease of use
Ease for ourselves to develop
Flexibility for future
Scalable and efficient

Data Format Approach:

SQL

Advantages:
Clients could plug directly into the DB
Clients could query anything - also a security issue if they perform malicious queries
Layer of security, rollback, and data backup

Disadvantages:
Heavy weight - maybe more complex than needed
Not human readable - may have to implement another layer for viewing
Security - giving clients too much access

JSON / XML

Advantages:
The data has a fixed format / size
Easy to distribute
Machine and human readable
Support for parsing in most programming languages
Add new data (companies) by adding new nodes
Easy file backup

Disadvantages:
If all info stored in a large file - sending all info is not efficient (client may only want one companies info)
Clients must parse data to query

Layer 2 Approach:

Could have a web service layer (rather than just SQL or FTP).

adv:
Additional security
View data
May be easier for integration

dis:
Clients can only query what we provide access too

Example Approach:

Design a web service - easy access for all client applications
Data stored in JSON
New JSON file for each date (date query/backup)
As data gets to large add new machines for newer dates (keep look up table)

Adv:
Easy to implement
Easy backup
Easy to integrate for client
Secure

Dis:
Not many available queries besides date - client must parse
